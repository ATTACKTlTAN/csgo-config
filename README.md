I believe that each of these workshops are essential to customize your game to have it feel perfect for YOU. They each provide a advanced level of customizability that you shoud take advantage of. I'll give a short rundown of what each map provides you with here: 

**"config generator"**, this workshop provides you with many features such as changing your keybinds, crosshair, map position, etc.

**"crosshair generator"**, this workshop allows you to customize your crosshair to your hearts content. (i prefer this one over the one in the config generator because it has far more options. 

**"viewmodel generator"**, this workshop provides you with the ability to change your personal viewmodel.
